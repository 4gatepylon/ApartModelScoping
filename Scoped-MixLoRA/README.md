# Scoped-MixLoRA: protecting LLM-based applications' instructions with a privilege-controlled mixture of low rank experts

Based on [MixLORA](https://arxiv.org/html/2404.15159v1) with influence from [AdapterSwap](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08417) and [Instruction Hierarchy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13208)

We use MixLoRA for fine-tuning, modifying the sparse mixture-of-experts to route exclusively based on the system prompt. The figure above shows the architecture of the MixLoRA transformer block. MixLoRA inserts the LoRA-based experts within the attention and feed-forward network block of a frozen pre-trained dense model; the top-k router is still in place but now uses only the first part of the hidden states (corresponding to the system prompt).

We fine-tune and evaluate [meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf) on our restricted model, and will report results.
